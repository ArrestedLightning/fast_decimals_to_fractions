# Fast Decimals To Fractions

This small web app was originally written by Alan Hensel, and used to be available at http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/fracs.html, which is no longer online.  Since I still use it pretty regularly and haven't really found an equivalent that I like, I thought I would upload it here so it maintains some visibility.  The source code states that it was intentionally released with no license and is intended to be easy to copy, so I believe this is OK.  If this is not the case, please contact me.
